    <string name="aboutthegametext">Scarne’s Dice is a turn-based dice game where players score points by rolling a die and then:
\n
if they roll a 1, score no points and lose their turn
\n
if they roll a 2 to 6:
\n
add the rolled value to their points
choose to either reroll or keep their score and end their turn
The winner is the first player that reaches (or exceeds) 100 points.
\n
For example, if a player starts their turn and rolls a 6, they can choose to either ‘hold’ and end their turn, in which case they can add the 6 to their score, or to reroll and potentially score more points.</string>
